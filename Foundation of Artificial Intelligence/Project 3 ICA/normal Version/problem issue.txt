  cell  	E	W	N	S
(1, 1)	0	0	0	1
(2, 1)	1	0	1	0
(3, 1)	0	0	0	1
(4, 1)	0	0	1	1

i want to create another random_obstacles.csv file which contain information of some random boxes (created by walls on all 4 size makes a box in maze) of particular size 2*2 with x in numbers. Now when i run sample algorithm(a *) on these maze, then it will read these both files and find path in the maze by using maze.csv and avoide the obstacles find in  random_obstacles.csv.
